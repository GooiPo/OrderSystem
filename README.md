> 3-tier Architecture


## 3. Client Tier
- Client tier (View) were written in `Javascript`, `HTML`, and `CSS`. This level of the architecture is what the user will interact with to access the features of our application.

## 4. Business Logic Tier
- The Business Logic Tier (Controller) were written using NodeJs and ExpressJS, and this tier represents the Application Server that will act as a bridge of communication for the Client Tier and Database Tier. This tier will serve HTML pages to the userâ€™s device and accept HTTP requests from the user and follow with the appropriate response.

## 5. Database Tier
The Database Tier (Model) will be hosting Mysql. This is where I will store all of the crucial data my application needs to function.
